Introduction/Business Plan
The idea is to open a café near to the student hub area in Delhi. The University of Delhi is divided into North campus and south campus, which makes these two places the hotspots for opening of cafes and restaurants. In order to open a café I would like to choose one of the location between Hudson Lane which is near the North Campus or Hauz Khas which is the hotspot location for students from south campus of Delhi University.

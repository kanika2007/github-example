Background
With the changing times, Indians no longer need a reason or a special occasion to eat out. Indians—across metro and non-metro cities—eat out simply because they want to experiment, love food, or that’s how they want to spend their free time. According to a recent survey, The socializers spend about ₹ 6,500 a month, eat out or order in about four times a month. This trend is even more common among college students in the age group of 18-25 years.
Introduction/Business Plan
The idea is to open a café near to the student hub area in Delhi. The University of Delhi is divided into North campus and south campus, which makes these two places the hotspots for opening of cafes and restaurants. In order to open a café, the two prime student locations are Hudson Lane which is near the North Campus and Hauz Khas which is the hotspot location for students from south campus of Delhi University.
The target audience is a client seeking to open a café targeted for students in the age group of 18-25 specifically and 16-35 in general.
